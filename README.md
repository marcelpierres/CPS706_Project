Implementing a Content Distribution Server

In Client.Java, I changed the PortNumber to 80 just to test out the code with actual servers because I didnt program the server yet, soo.... 
Yay HTTP 1.1 works, now its time to implment the servers of HIS.Java an Her.Java. 

Test out the code on the servers first then We can implement the DNS after words
